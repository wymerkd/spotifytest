##Specs

* _The application makers an Api call to the Spotify Api_

* _The Spotify Api authorizes the user and the Application by a 0Auth process of creating and passing a unique token_

* _The Application takes a user selected genre and inserts it into the Api call_

* _The Application takes a user selected valence, converts it into decimal form and inserts it into the Api call_

* _The application sends the Api call with the user generated genre & valence to the Spotify Api_

  * _Example Input: User selects "Metal" & a valence of "Shitting Fucking Rainbows"_
  * _Example Output: Your Very Own SpottyFried Playlist!
